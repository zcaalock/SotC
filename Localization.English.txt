quest.name,The sound of silence
quest.description,<i>Solve the mystery of the disappearance of John, the son of your good friend, and explore the secrets of an old Baptist church from the turn of the century.</i>\n\nThe scenario is designed for 2-5 Investigators and requires tiles from the 1st edition of the Mansions of Madness. In this scenario, in most cases, the description of how to set the tokens has been abandoned. This is a deliberate move to encourage Investigators to carefully track changes in the application as well as an element of mechanics. If you noticed a token after some time, it should be placed on the board and treated as newly discovered.\n\n<b>Note: if during the game there is a command to remove all tiles from the board, the Investigator Phase starts over.</b>\n\nThe scenario is storyline oriented. It has several endings, which influence the length of the game.\n\nAny comments can be sent to the following address:https://github.com/zcaalock/SotC/issues\n\nThe scenario is created using:https://github.com/NPBruce/valkyrie
